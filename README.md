# Odeko Client Side Challenge

## Project Description

You're at a budding agency and your first client has asked you to implement a NYTimes Article Browser App using the API:
https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timeswire-product/1/overview

You will need to create a developer account and generate an API key and allow access to Timeswire Product. See below to get started

https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started

You're expected to take ~3h on this project. To ensure we respect your time, please do not spend more than that amount of time!

Just jot down what you would do if you had more time.

## Instructions

* You've been added as a collaborator on our private project repository.
  Fulfill the requirements below. Let us know when you're done and open
  a PR for review. Good luck!

## Requirements

*Note: We don't expect you to complete all the below requirements in the allotted timeframe. However, it is up to you to figure out which features to prioritize. You can choose to prioritize based on your strengths/ interests, or on what you think the most important features are.*

* Create an endless scrolling article browser, the articles should be shown in order of recency

* Consider how you would structure the codebase to ensure testability of the codebase

* Each article should display the Title, Published Date (in MM/DD/YYYY),
Image if it exists, and an abstract of the article. Don't worry about how the article looks! As long as it's readable we're not looking for designers.

* If you click on the article it will open the article in a new page in web browser

* Create Tabs, either as a bottom navigation or top tabs navigation to browse between the following sections:
  * All, World, Business, Art
  * Bonus: Make it so that it can browse through the entire list of sections see https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timeswire-product/1/routes/content/section-list.json/get

* The app should work in both portrait and landscape mode

* This api returns data in real time, how could you ensure that the app has the most up to date data?
You can write a rudimentary solution for this, or if you don't have time we can talk about it in the interview.

## What we're looking for

* We're looking for code that is easy to read and gives us a high level understanding of your
knowledge in your domain expertise

* Please leave comments in places where you werenâ€™t quite sure if you
  were solving the problem correctly to let us know that you've thought about it
  and made a conscious decision.

* Please ensure that this codebase will run on the most recent version of Android Studio/ X-Code

* We will be reviewing your solution commit-by-commit so that we can
  understand your thought process. So instead of putting everything in a single
  giant commit, please make frequent cohesive commits so we
  can see what your work progression looks like.

* Once you're finished send out a PR to this repository.
